&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__ Hi! üëã__. This project is a super cool little programmable RGB light idea! RGB lights are made up of LEDs in the three basic colors of red, green, and blue, and by adjusting their brightness, they can be mixed to create almost any color of light ‚ú®. Want romantic pink or cool purple-blue? Easy peasy! üé®.
Whether you want to create a cozy atmosphere or a sparkling light show, this RGB light project will allow you to play around and light up your creative inspiration! üöÄ

## Project Information.
Adjusting the brightness of RGB lights is actually quite simple - it's done by adjusting the amount of current. We usually use **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** technology, which changes the brightness by controlling the proportion of time that the LED is "switched on and off" üí°. You can use a microcontroller or other control chip to send control signals to the PWM controller to control the current intensity of the red, green and blue colors, the PWM controller will be based on these signals to adjust the brightness of each color, thus creating a variety of dazzling lighting effects üåà.

## Functional Features

- üåà Colorful: support a variety of color combinations, programmable control to achieve cool lighting effects, light up your creative space.
- üîß DIY fun: the programmable design allows you to give free play to set various lighting modes to meet personalized needs.
- üîß Low Power Consumption and High Brightness: High-efficiency LED light beads, both low power consumption and high brightness, make your light show shine for a long time.
- ü§ñ Intelligent control: compatible with a variety of control platforms, easily programmed through Arduino, ESP32, etc. to create a unique lighting experience.

## Installation and operation

### precondition
Software relies on: __Arduino IDE__ etc.
Hardware Requirements: Three DuPont cables, programmable RGB lights, serial cable, etc.
Requirements: __Arduino library__ etc.
### Arduino IDE Installation Steps
```
Link: upload later
```
### Pinout and Wiring
- VIN: The VCC pin should be connected to the 3.3V power supply pin of the ESP32 development board or other compatible development board (or select the appropriate operating voltage according to the sensor specifications).
- GND: Reference ground.
- RGBÔºöSend control signal
- NCÔºöNo connection required
- Other pins: Programmable GPIO pins for additional functions such as measurement preparation and threshold interrupts.

### concrete step
1. Connect the Arduino UNO using the serial cable.
2. Follow the wiring diagram to connect the Arduino and the programmable RGB lights, then connect the serial port to the computer USB port.
3. Select the corresponding file of the effect you want to achieve, so as to light up all the lights, running lights, running lights, breathing lights, respectively.
4. As an example, open the Marquee routine file, open Marquee.ino

### compile and run
